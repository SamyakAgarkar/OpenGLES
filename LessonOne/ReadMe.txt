In this code, I have just initialized the GLView and rendered 3 rotating triangles using OpenGL ES 2 in Android.
The window is fullscreen.

You will have to make a new project in Android Studios (or Ecllipse, whichever you choose) and copy src files (and make some minor tweaks...public class names and stuff...)

No Comments are available as it would have taken me a long time to explain each and every line using comments.
I will post a tutorial video on my Youtube Channel explaining the code.
